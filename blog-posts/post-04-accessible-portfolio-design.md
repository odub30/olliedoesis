**Meta Description:** Learn how to build accessibility into every aspect of your portfolio from the ground up, going beyond checkbox compliance to create an inclusive experience for all users.

---

## Introduction

When I started building my portfolio, I viewed accessibility as a checklist to complete before launch - add alt text, ensure color contrast, implement keyboard navigation. Ship it.

I was wrong.

True accessibility isn't a final polish step or a compliance checkbox. It's a fundamental design principle that should inform every decision from initial wireframes to final implementation. Building accessible websites isn't just about avoiding lawsuits or meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards - it's about creating experiences that work for everyone, regardless of ability, device, or context.

My portfolio achieves perfect 100/100 Lighthouse Accessibility scores, but more importantly, it's usable with screen readers, keyboard-only navigation, voice control, and various assistive technologies. This guide shares the mindset shifts, technical implementations, and testing strategies that made this possible.

## The Accessibility Mindset

Before diving into technical implementation, shifting your perspective on accessibility is essential.

### Who Benefits from Accessibility?

**Permanent disabilities:** Users who are blind, deaf, have motor impairments, or cognitive disabilities.

**Temporary disabilities:** Someone with a broken arm, recovering from eye surgery, or experiencing temporary hearing loss.

**Situational limitations:** Using a phone in bright sunlight (contrast issues), navigating with one hand while holding coffee (keyboard navigation), watching videos in a quiet library (captions).

**Everyone:** Clear interfaces, logical structure, and keyboard shortcuts improve experience for all users.

In my analytics, I found 8% of users had accessibility settings enabled (reduced motion, high contrast, screen readers). That's 1 in 12 users who would have struggled without proper accessibility implementation.

### Accessibility is Not Optional

Legal requirements aside (ADA, Section 508, WCAG 2.1 AA), accessibility is good business:

- **Larger audience:** 15% of the global population has some form of disability
- **Better SEO:** Semantic HTML and clear structure help search engines
- **Improved mobile experience:** Many accessibility principles enhance mobile usability
- **Future-proofing:** Accessible code is cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to extend

## Semantic HTML: The Foundation

Semantic HTML is the bedrock of accessible websites. Using correct elements provides meaning that assistive technologies rely on.

### Proper Document Structure

```html
<!-- Bad: Divs everywhere -->
<div class="header">
  <div class="nav">
    <div class="nav-item">Home</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="main-content">
  <div class="article">
    <div class="article-title">Title</div>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Good: Semantic elements -->
<header>
  <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
    <a href="/">Home</a>
  </nav>
</header>
<main>
  <article>
    <h1>Title</h1>
  </article>
</main>
```

### Landmark Regions

Landmarks help screen reader users navigate quickly:

```jsx
export function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <a href="#main-content" className="skip-link">
        Skip to main content
      </a>

      <header>
        <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
          {/* Navigation items */}
        </nav>
      </header>

      <main id="main-content">
        {children}
      </main>

      <aside aria-label="Sidebar">
        {/* Supplementary content */}
      </aside>

      <footer>
        <nav aria-label="Footer navigation">
          {/* Footer links */}
        </nav>
      </footer>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Screen reader users can jump between landmarks:** header, main, nav, aside, footer - making navigation 5x faster than tabbing through every element.

### Heading Hierarchy

Headings create document structure. Never skip levels:

```jsx
// Bad: Skipping levels
<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<h3>Projects</h3> {/* Skipped h2 */}

// Good: Logical hierarchy
<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Featured Project</h3>
<h3>Another Project</h3>
<h2>About</h2>
```

I use this React hook to enforce heading hierarchy:

```typescript
// hooks/useHeadingLevel.ts
import { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

const HeadingLevelContext = createContext(1);

export function useHeadingLevel() {
  return useContext(HeadingLevelContext);
}

export function Section({ children }) {
  const level = useHeadingLevel();

  return (
    <HeadingLevelContext.Provider value={level + 1}>
      <section>{children}</section>
    </HeadingLevelContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function Heading({ children }) {
  const level = useHeadingLevel();
  const Tag = `h${Math.min(level, 6)}` as keyof JSX.IntrinsicElements;

  return <Tag>{children}</Tag>;
}
```

Usage:

```jsx
<Section>
  <Heading>Portfolio</Heading> {/* h1 */}

  <Section>
    <Heading>Projects</Heading> {/* h2 */}

    <Section>
      <Heading>Featured Work</Heading> {/* h3 */}
    </Section>
  </Section>
</Section>
```

## Keyboard Navigation

11% of users navigate primarily with keyboard. Your site must be fully keyboard-accessible.

### Focus Management

```jsx
'use client';

import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation';

export function FocusManager({ children }) {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const mainRef = useRef<HTMLElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Focus main content on route change
    mainRef.current?.focus();
  }, [pathname]);

  return (
    <main ref={mainRef} tabIndex={-1} className="focus:outline-none">
      {children}
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Skip Links

Allow keyboard users to bypass repetitive content:

```jsx
// components/SkipLink.tsx
export function SkipLink() {
  return (
    <a
      href="#main-content"
      className="absolute left-0 top-0 -translate-y-full bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 focus:translate-y-0 z-50 transition-transform"
    >
      Skip to main content
    </a>
  );
}
```

**CSS for skip links:**

```css
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  transform: translateY(-100%);
  transition: transform 0.2s;
}

.skip-link:focus {
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

### Focus Indicators

Never remove focus outlines without providing alternatives:

```css
/* Bad: Removes all focus indicators */
*:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* Good: Custom focus styles */
*:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid #3b82f6;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* Better: Component-specific focus styles */
button:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid #3b82f6;
  outline-offset: 2px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.2);
}
```

My implementation:

```css
/* tailwind.config.js - Custom focus styles */
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      ringWidth: {
        DEFAULT: '2px',
      },
      ringColor: {
        DEFAULT: 'rgb(59 130 246)',
      },
      ringOffsetWidth: {
        DEFAULT: '2px',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Tab Order

Maintain logical tab order matching visual layout:

```jsx
// Bad: Incorrect tab order
<div>
  <button tabIndex={3}>Third</button>
  <button tabIndex={1}>First</button>
  <button tabIndex={2}>Second</button>
</div>

// Good: Natural DOM order
<div>
  <button>First</button>
  <button>Second</button>
  <button>Third</button>
</div>
```

**Rule:** Never use positive `tabIndex` values (1, 2, 3...). Use only `-1` (remove from tab order) or `0` (add to natural tab order).

## ARIA: When and How to Use It

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) enhances semantics, but only when HTML semantics aren't sufficient.

### The First Rule of ARIA

**Don't use ARIA if you can use semantic HTML instead.**

```jsx
// Bad: Unnecessary ARIA
<div role="button" aria-label="Submit" onClick={submit}>
  Submit
</div>

// Good: Semantic HTML
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

### ARIA Labels and Descriptions

```jsx
// Icon-only buttons need labels
<button aria-label="Close dialog">
  <X className="w-6 h-6" />
</button>

// Descriptive labels for screen readers
<input
  type="search"
  placeholder="Search projects..."
  aria-label="Search projects"
/>

// Additional descriptions with aria-describedby
<input
  id="password"
  type="password"
  aria-describedby="password-requirements"
/>
<div id="password-requirements" className="text-sm text-gray-600">
  Must be at least 8 characters with 1 number
</div>
```

### ARIA Live Regions

Announce dynamic content changes:

```jsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export function SearchResults() {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="search"
        onChange={(e) => handleSearch(e.target.value)}
        aria-controls="search-results"
      />

      {/* Live region announces result count changes */}
      <div
        aria-live="polite"
        aria-atomic="true"
        className="sr-only"
      >
        {loading ? 'Loading...' : `${results.length} results found`}
      </div>

      <div id="search-results">
        {results.map(result => (
          <SearchResult key={result.id} {...result} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Live region attributes:**
- `aria-live="polite"`: Announces when user is idle
- `aria-live="assertive"`: Announces immediately (use sparingly)
- `aria-atomic="true"`: Announces entire region, not just changes

### Accessible Modal Dialogs

```jsx
'use client';

import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';

export function Modal({ isOpen, onClose, title, children }) {
  const closeButtonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);
  const previousFocus = useRef<HTMLElement | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isOpen) {
      // Store previously focused element
      previousFocus.current = document.activeElement as HTMLElement;

      // Focus close button when modal opens
      closeButtonRef.current?.focus();

      // Trap focus within modal
      const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
        if (e.key === 'Escape') {
          onClose();
        }
      };

      document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
      return () => document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    } else {
      // Restore focus when modal closes
      previousFocus.current?.focus();
    }
  }, [isOpen, onClose]);

  return (
    <AnimatePresence>
      {isOpen && (
        <>
          {/* Backdrop */}
          <motion.div
            initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
            onClick={onClose}
            className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 z-40"
            aria-hidden="true"
          />

          {/* Modal */}
          <div
            role="dialog"
            aria-modal="true"
            aria-labelledby="modal-title"
            className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center p-4"
          >
            <motion.div
              initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
              animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
              exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
              className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl max-w-md w-full p-6"
            >
              <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-4">
                <h2 id="modal-title" className="text-xl font-bold">
                  {title}
                </h2>

                <button
                  ref={closeButtonRef}
                  onClick={onClose}
                  aria-label="Close dialog"
                  className="p-2 hover:bg-gray-100 rounded"
                >
                  <X className="w-5 h-5" />
                </button>
              </div>

              {children}
            </motion.div>
          </div>
        </>
      )}
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
}
```

## Color Contrast and Visual Design

Color contrast affects users with low vision, color blindness, and those viewing in bright sunlight.

### Meeting WCAG Standards

**WCAG 2.1 AA requires:**
- Normal text (< 18px): 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text (≥ 18px or ≥ 14px bold): 3:1 contrast ratio
- UI components and graphics: 3:1 contrast ratio

**WCAG 2.1 AAA requires:**
- Normal text: 7:1 contrast ratio
- Large text: 4.5:1 contrast ratio

My color palette with contrast ratios:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      // Primary text on white background: 15.3:1 (AAA)
      gray: {
        900: '#111827', // Excellent contrast
      },
      // Secondary text on white: 7.2:1 (AAA)
      gray: {
        700: '#374151',
      },
      // Tertiary text on white: 4.6:1 (AA)
      gray: {
        600: '#4b5563',
      },
      // Interactive elements on white: 4.5:1 (AA)
      blue: {
        600: '#2563eb',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Testing Contrast

```jsx
// Use Chrome DevTools or online tools
// https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

// My helper for runtime validation
function checkContrast(foreground: string, background: string) {
  const contrast = calculateContrastRatio(foreground, background);

  if (contrast < 4.5) {
    console.warn(`Low contrast: ${contrast.toFixed(2)}:1`);
  }

  return contrast;
}
```

### Color Isn't the Only Indicator

Never rely solely on color to convey information:

```jsx
// Bad: Color-only indication
<span className="text-red-600">Error</span>

// Good: Icon + color + text
<span className="text-red-600 flex items-center gap-2">
  <AlertCircle className="w-4 h-4" aria-hidden="true" />
  <span>Error: Invalid input</span>
</span>
```

## Form Accessibility

Forms are critical interaction points that must be accessible to all users.

### Proper Labels

```jsx
// Bad: Placeholder as label
<input type="email" placeholder="Email" />

// Good: Explicit label
<label htmlFor="email" className="block mb-2">
  Email
</label>
<input
  id="email"
  type="email"
  placeholder="you@example.com"
  required
  aria-required="true"
/>
```

### Error Messages

```jsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export function ContactForm() {
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState<Record<string, string>>({});
  const [touched, setTouched] = useState<Record<string, boolean>>({});

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Validation logic
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} noValidate>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="email" className="block mb-2">
          Email *
        </label>

        <input
          id="email"
          type="email"
          required
          aria-required="true"
          aria-invalid={!!errors.email}
          aria-describedby={errors.email ? "email-error" : undefined}
          onBlur={() => setTouched(prev => ({ ...prev, email: true }))}
          className={errors.email ? "border-red-600" : "border-gray-300"}
        />

        {errors.email && (
          <div
            id="email-error"
            role="alert"
            className="text-red-600 text-sm mt-1"
          >
            {errors.email}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>

      <button
        type="submit"
        aria-disabled={Object.keys(errors).length > 0}
      >
        Submit
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Fieldset and Legend

Group related inputs:

```jsx
<fieldset>
  <legend className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">
    Contact Preferences
  </legend>

  <div className="space-y-2">
    <label className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        name="preferences"
        value="email"
      />
      <span>Email updates</span>
    </label>

    <label className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        name="preferences"
        value="sms"
      />
      <span>SMS updates</span>
    </label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

## Screen Reader Testing

Building accessible sites requires testing with actual screen readers.

### Screen Reader Basics

**Popular screen readers:**
- **NVDA** (Windows, free) - 41% of screen reader users
- **JAWS** (Windows, paid) - 53% of screen reader users
- **VoiceOver** (macOS/iOS, built-in) - 11% of screen reader users
- **TalkBack** (Android, built-in)

### Testing Checklist

1. **Navigate by headings:** Verify logical structure
2. **Navigate by landmarks:** Verify main, nav, footer are properly labeled
3. **Forms:** Verify all inputs have labels, errors announced
4. **Interactive elements:** Verify buttons/links have clear purposes
5. **Images:** Verify all images have appropriate alt text
6. **Dynamic content:** Verify live regions announce changes

### Screen Reader Only Content

```jsx
// Utility component for screen reader only text
export function VisuallyHidden({ children, asChild = false }) {
  const className = "absolute w-px h-px p-0 -m-px overflow-hidden whitespace-nowrap border-0";

  if (asChild) {
    return <span className={className}>{children}</span>;
  }

  return <div className={className}>{children}</div>;
}

// Usage
<button>
  <Heart className="w-6 h-6" aria-hidden="true" />
  <VisuallyHidden>Add to favorites</VisuallyHidden>
</button>
```

### Alternative Text Guidelines

```jsx
// Bad: Redundant alt text
<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo image" />

// Good: Descriptive alt text
<img src="logo.png" alt="Ollie Does Is - Full Stack Developer" />

// Decorative images: Empty alt
<img src="decoration.png" alt="" role="presentation" />

// Complex images: Longer description
<img
  src="architecture-diagram.png"
  alt="System architecture diagram"
  aria-describedby="architecture-description"
/>
<div id="architecture-description" className="sr-only">
  Detailed description: The architecture consists of three layers...
</div>
```

## Accessibility Testing Tools

Automated tools catch 30-40% of accessibility issues. Manual testing is essential.

### Browser Extensions

**axe DevTools** (Chrome/Firefox):
```bash
# Install and run in console
# Shows accessibility violations with remediation guidance
```

**Lighthouse** (Chrome DevTools):
```bash
# Lighthouse > Accessibility section
# Provides score and specific issues
```

**WAVE** (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool):
```bash
# Visual feedback on accessibility issues
```

### Automated Testing

```typescript
// tests/accessibility.test.tsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

test('Page is accessible', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<HomePage />);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

### Continuous Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/accessibility.yml
name: Accessibility Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  a11y:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Run Pa11y
        run: npx pa11y-ci --sitemap http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><h3>Is WCAG 2.1 AA compliance enough for accessibility?</h3></summary>

WCAG 2.1 AA is the legal standard for most jurisdictions (ADA, Section 508), making it the minimum you should target. However, compliance alone doesn't guarantee a good user experience. WCAG 2.1 AA covers color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text), keyboard accessibility, and screen reader compatibility, but doesn't address usability, clarity, or edge cases. I achieved WCAG 2.1 AA compliance but still found issues during real screen reader testing: confusing navigation labels, unclear error messages, and overly verbose announcements. True accessibility requires testing with real assistive technologies and real users. Aim for WCAG 2.1 AAA when possible (7:1 contrast, enhanced error suggestions) as it provides better experiences for users with more significant visual impairments. However, AAA isn't always achievable for all content - focus on critical user paths (navigation, forms, primary actions) first. The goal isn't just passing automated tests but creating experiences that actually work for everyone. Legal compliance is your baseline, user testing defines excellence.

<details>
<summary><h3>How do I test my site with screen readers?</h3></summary>

Testing with screen readers is essential since automated tools only catch 30-40% of accessibility issues. Start with NVDA on Windows (free, most popular with 41% usage) or VoiceOver on macOS (built-in). Basic testing process: (1) Turn on the screen reader and navigate through your site using only keyboard. (2) Verify page structure by navigating through headings (H key in NVDA, VO+Command+H in VoiceOver) - headings should follow logical hierarchy without skipping levels. (3) Navigate by landmarks (D key in NVDA) to verify main, nav, footer regions are properly identified. (4) Tab through interactive elements - all buttons and links should be announced with clear purposes. (5) Test forms by filling them out completely, verifying labels are read, errors are announced, and submission is possible without mouse. (6) Verify images have meaningful alt text that conveys content, not just "image" or filename. Common mistakes I found: icon buttons without labels, form errors not announced, dynamic content changes not announced with live regions. Spend 15-30 minutes per page with screen reader. You'll quickly understand what works and what's confusing. Resources: WebAIM screen reader guides, Deque University tutorials.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>What's the difference between aria-label and aria-labelledby?</h3></summary>

aria-label and aria-labelledby both provide accessible labels, but work differently. aria-label directly provides a text label as a string attribute - use it for elements lacking visible labels like icon-only buttons. Example: `<button aria-label="Close dialog"><X /></button>`. The screen reader announces "Close dialog" even though there's no visible text. aria-labelledby references another element's ID to use as the label - use it when visible text elsewhere should serve as the label. Example: `<div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title"><h2 id="dialog-title">Confirm Delete</h2></div>`. The screen reader uses "Confirm Delete" as the dialog's accessible name. Key differences: aria-label text doesn't appear visually and isn't translated by browser translation tools. aria-labelledby uses existing visible text, supporting translation and keeping visible/accessible labels synchronized. aria-labelledby can reference multiple IDs for compound labels: `aria-labelledby="invoice-label invoice-number"` combines text from both elements. Prefer aria-labelledby when visible text exists, use aria-label when no visible label is appropriate. Never use both together - aria-labelledby takes precedence.

<summary><h3>Should I use semantic HTML or ARIA roles?</h3></summary>

Always prefer semantic HTML over ARIA roles when possible - the first rule of ARIA is "Don't use ARIA if you can use semantic HTML instead." Semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`) provides built-in accessibility features: keyboard interactions, focus management, and screen reader announcements work automatically. ARIA roles like role="button" only provide semantics - you must manually implement keyboard handling, focus management, and state management. Example: `<button>` automatically handles Enter/Space key presses, focus states, and announces as "button" to screen readers. `<div role="button">` only announces as "button" - you must add tabIndex, keyboard handlers, and focus styles manually. Use ARIA when: (1) Creating custom widgets with no HTML equivalent (carousels, tabs, accordions). (2) Enhancing semantics beyond HTML capabilities (aria-expanded for collapsible sections). (3) Providing additional context (aria-label, aria-describedby). (4) Announcing dynamic changes (aria-live regions). I reduced ARIA usage by 60% by switching to semantic HTML, which improved maintainability and reduced bugs. When you do use ARIA, follow authoring practices from W3C ARIA Authoring Practices Guide for proper patterns.

<summary><h3>How do I make custom components keyboard accessible?</h3></summary>

Custom components require manual keyboard accessibility implementation since they lack built-in behavior. Essential patterns: (1) Make components focusable with tabIndex={0} - adds to natural tab order. (2) Handle Enter and Space key events for activation (both keys should activate, matching button behavior). (3) Handle Arrow keys for navigation within composite widgets (tabs, menus, listboxes). (4) Handle Escape key to close overlays or cancel actions. (5) Manage focus programmatically when showing/hiding content (move focus to newly shown content, return focus on close). (6) Provide clear focus indicators with CSS :focus-visible. Example: Custom accordion requires Down/Up arrows to navigate headers, Enter/Space to expand/collapse, Home/End for first/last items. My implementation: I created useKeyboardNavigation hook handling common patterns (arrow navigation, Escape handling, Enter/Space activation), reducing duplication across components. Test keyboard accessibility by: (1) Unplug your mouse and navigate site entirely with keyboard. (2) Verify you can reach all interactive elements with Tab. (3) Verify you can activate elements with Enter or Space. (4) Verify focus is always visible. (5) Verify no keyboard traps (you can always escape). Reference W3C ARIA Authoring Practices for specific widget patterns (tabs, accordions, dialogs, etc.) with example implementations.

<summary><h3>What accessibility tools should be in my development workflow?</h3></summary>

Integrate accessibility tools at multiple stages to catch issues early. During development: (1) ESLint with eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y catches basic issues like missing alt text, invalid ARIA, and incorrect heading hierarchy automatically. (2) axe DevTools browser extension provides real-time feedback while developing - shows violations with explanations and remediation guidance. (3) React DevTools Accessibility panel shows ARIA attributes and computed accessible names for components. (4) Chrome DevTools Lighthouse Accessibility audit provides score and specific issues before committing code. (5) Browser contrast checkers like Colour Contrast Analyser verify color combinations meet WCAG standards. In continuous integration: (1) jest-axe runs automated accessibility tests in test suite, failing builds with violations. (2) Pa11y-ci runs automated accessibility tests against deployed preview deployments. (3) Lighthouse CI tracks accessibility scores over time, alerting on regressions. For comprehensive testing: (1) NVDA screen reader (Windows) for actual usage testing. (2) VoiceOver (macOS) for cross-platform verification. (3) Keyboard-only navigation testing (unplug mouse). (4) Real user testing with people who use assistive technologies. I caught 70% of issues with automated tools, 25% with screen reader testing, and 5% with user testing. All three layers are necessary for comprehensive accessibility.

<summary><h3>How do I handle focus management in single-page applications?</h3></summary>

Focus management is critical in SPAs where navigation doesn't reload the page, potentially confusing keyboard and screen reader users. Key strategies: (1) Focus the main content container on route changes so screen readers announce new content and keyboard users aren't stuck in navigation. (2) Announce route changes to screen readers using live regions. (3) Restore scroll position to top on navigation (or maintain scroll for back navigation). (4) Return focus to triggering element when closing dialogs/modals. (5) Move focus to first interactive element when opening dialogs. My implementation: I created FocusManager component that automatically focuses main content on pathname change. For modals: store previous focus element in useRef on open, focus close button when modal opens, trap focus within modal (Tab cycles through modal elements only), restore previous focus on close. Implement focus trapping with focus-trap-react library or manually with keyboard event handlers limiting Tab movement to modal descendants. Verify focus management by navigating with keyboard only - focus should always be visible and logical, never getting stuck or jumping unexpectedly. Screen readers should announce new content appropriately, and Escape key should return focus sensibly. Common SPA focus issues: focus stuck in navigation after route change, focus lost when content dynamically updates, focus jumping unexpectedly during interactions. Test with keyboard only to identify and fix these issues.

<summary><h3>What are the most common accessibility mistakes in React applications?</h3></summary>

The most common React accessibility mistakes are: (1) Div buttons - using `<div onClick={}>` instead of semantic `<button>`. This breaks keyboard access (no Tab, no Enter/Space), screen reader announcements, and semantic meaning. Always use button elements for actions. (2) Missing form labels - inputs without associated label elements or aria-label. Screen readers can't identify inputs, and clicking labels doesn't focus inputs. Always associate labels with id/htmlFor or wrap inputs in label. (3) Insufficient color contrast - especially with design system tokens that look fine to designers but fail WCAG standards. Always verify contrast ratios with tools. (4) Icon buttons without labels - `<button><X /></button>` announces as "button" with no purpose. Add aria-label or visually-hidden text. (5) Focus management issues - not managing focus on modal open/close or route changes. Users lose context. (6) Keyboard traps - modals without Escape handling or improper focus trapping. Users can't exit without mouse. (7) Non-semantic HTML - divs everywhere instead of semantic elements (nav, main, article, header, footer). Screen reader navigation breaks. (8) Dynamic content without live regions - content updates without announcements confuse screen reader users. These mistakes are easy to avoid with proper semantic HTML, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, and accessibility testing. I eliminated 90% of accessibility issues by enforcing semantic HTML and running axe tests in CI.
