## Overview

A modern portfolio website built from scratch to showcase projects and technical skills. The site features a clean, professional design with a blue and purple color palette, dark mode support, and smooth animations. Built using Next.js 15's App Router for optimal performance and SEO, with server-side rendering and static generation where appropriate.

The development process involved learning modern web development practices, debugging compatibility issues between Tailwind CSS versions, implementing responsive design patterns, and deploying to production with continuous integration via Vercel.

## Problem

Needed a professional online presence to showcase development work and technical capabilities. The site had to be fast, accessible, mobile-responsive, and maintainable while demonstrating proficiency with modern web technologies.

## Solution

Built a server-rendered Next.js application with TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. Implemented a component-based architecture with reusable UI elements, custom hooks for state management, and CSS variables for theming. Used Claude Code and Claude AI as development tools to accelerate implementation and troubleshooting.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **React 19** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS 3** - Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** - Animation library
- **Vercel** - Deployment and hosting
- **Git/GitHub** - Version control

## Key Features
