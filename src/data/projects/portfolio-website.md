# Portfolio Website Development Journey

## Project Overview

This portfolio serves as both a showcase of my development skills and a comprehensive learning project in modern web development practices. Built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript, it demonstrates proficiency in current industry standards while documenting the entire development process.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Security**: Environment-based API key management and input validation

### Key Features
1. **Dynamic GitHub Integration** - Automatically pulls and displays repository data
2. **Secure Contact Form** - Server-side validation with spam protection
3. **Educational Documentation** - Complete build process with screenshots
4. **Mobile-First Design** - Responsive design optimized for all devices
5. **Answer Engine Optimization** - Structured data for AI search visibility
